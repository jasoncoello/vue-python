# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please first fork the repo, update and create a Pull Request.

To ensure you'll be working on the right feature in the right way,

- Understand how we project manage by reading the [README](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django)

### Branch Naming

The default branches provided by git flow are:
* `master`
* `dist`
* `develop`

Always work off of `develop` and NOT `master`.

We use either `dist` or `master` to create the template from vue-cli. The versioning section in the README [here](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/vue-django/blob/master/README.md#version-notice) explains more.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. Add relevant files/ folders to the .gitingore.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface/ process, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. We may merge the Pull Request in once we have the sign-off of two other developers or [the repo owner](https://github.com/NdagiStanley).


## Ideas/ Requests/ Suggestions

Add them as issues in the original CLI [repo](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues) and tag them as `ideas` or `suggestions`.

We'll try to keep up with the original and we welcome contributions to help bring the awesomeness of VueJS into Django. :heart:
